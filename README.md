This project is under-construction. 


Installation
1. The arduino code depends upon Timer library which can be installed as follows:
Download the library from here:

https://github.com/JChristensen/Timer

As with all libraries, unzip the file into the 'libraries' folder in your Arduino directory, which will be in something like 'My Documents\Arduino' on Windows, 'Documents/Arduino' on Mac etc. If this is the first library you have installed, you will need to create a directory there called 'libraries'.
